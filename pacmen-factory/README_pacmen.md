# pacmen

The modification of the DIV continues incorporating an old pac-man exercise adding in a few layers of complexity. 

1. Make a pacman factory
2. Pacmen must bounce off walls
3. Pacmen must instantiate with a random velocity and position
4. Bonus if you can make them switch direction hitting the edge (failed this last one as they *also* switch direction they are facing when hitting the ceiling).
5. Credit Ilya Flaks for sharing his code.
