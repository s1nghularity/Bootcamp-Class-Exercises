## Callbacks - Using ***sort*** and ***compare(a,b)*** to Organize Public Data
:beginner:We needed to organize Chicago City public salary data lowest to highest<br>

:heavy_check_mark:Used a conventional **compare(a,b)** argument to ***sort*** through salary data.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:Understanding that (a,b) and *item* correlate to eachother enabled comparison through a.salary and b.salary.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:Previously written code starting at line 42 passed the datapoints through Google charts.<br><br><br>
