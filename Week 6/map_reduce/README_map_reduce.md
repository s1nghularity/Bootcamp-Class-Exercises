## Using ***.map*** & ***.reduce*** to Manipulate Arrays

:beginner:Array manipulation methods using *.map* aand *.reduce*<br>

:heavy_check_mark:In the map.html file you can see the use of .map to compute the square root of each value in the *numbers* array.<br>

:heavy_check_mark:The mapped array was assinged to a variable, which was then passed through *JSON.stringify()* to output the data in readable key:value pairs.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:In reduce_00.html *.reduce* added together the values in the *numbers* array using the parameters *previous* and *current*.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:In reduce_01 we used *current* in *previous* rather than *current* + *previous* to add together the number of occurences of a value in a given array.<br><br><br>
