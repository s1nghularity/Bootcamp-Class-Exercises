## Callbacks - Using *For Each* to Grab Data
:beginner:In this exercise we were tasked with identifying vendor payments and adding them all together with the total printed in the console log.<br>

:heavy_check_mark:Used a *for each* loop to run through the array of data in payments_2005_to_2010.js.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:Used **add** as a *callback function* used in the **for each** loop.<br> 

:heavy_check_mark:Identified the tenth index position as the total payment value to be added together, with that indexed position adding together payment from a vendor from 2005 to 2010.<br>   

:heavy_check_mark:Understanding the use of **add** as a callback function and recognizing the data structure starting at line 355 also necessary.<br><br><br>
