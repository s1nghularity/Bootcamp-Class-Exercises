## My First Puzzle
This was an in-class exercise that really piqued my interest upon starting this course. 

It required understanding:
- *how to link HTML and JS files*
- *for loops*
- *iterate through an entire array* 

To be frank it only required uncommenting code at the bottom of the magic.js file, but understanding how the painting was actually being created and to understand how and why functions were executed was the real alchemy.

### Woohoo!
