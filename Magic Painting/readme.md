##My First Puzzle
This was an in-class exercise that really piqued my interest upon starting this course. 

It required understanding:
-*how to link HTML and JS files*
-*the use of for loops*
-*iterate through an entire array* 

It also required understanding which parts of the first section of the code applied to the bottom section of the code in magic.js

###Woohoo!###
