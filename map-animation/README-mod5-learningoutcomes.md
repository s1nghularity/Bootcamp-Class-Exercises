## Map Animation Exercise
Project Title + Description + HowTo Run + Future roadmap + License

With the MapBox API loaded into the header, we were tasked with marking the bus route from MIT to Harvard. Used MapBox to place a marker at the start of the route and to center the map. Then a *for loop* to run through all the coordinates.

To run, click the 'See Code Live' button and from there click the button which says 'SHOW STOPS FROM SAINIK FARMS TO NDTV'. This maps a route I took daily when working in New Delhi as a journalist in a former life. I also added a customized button credit @adamgiebl from uiverse.io

No future plans to upate this exercise.
